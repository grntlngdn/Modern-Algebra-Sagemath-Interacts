# Modern-Algebra-Sagemath-Interacts
These four interacts were created for an experiment on advanced mathematical thinking. Some teachers may find them useful for an abstract (modern) algebra course.

These interacts are setup for a SageMath notebook. For each file without an extension, its contents can be copied into one of the notebook's worksheets by clicking on a worksheets edit button and saving the text there. Alternatively, the text for the interacts (inside the triple curly braces starting with "@interact" in the files for the interacts) can be copied on its own into a worksheet cell. Some files (like interacts 1 and 4) will need the code for the attached files (near the top) to give the path for the relevant file. For each problem number, the first problem of problem set a (in the LaTeX files) uses the interact (with the same number), and the second problem is given in full in problem set b. The files in the folder labeled experiment are for the original experiment. If for some reason you are interested in the experiment, it would probably be better if you get the entire set of .sws (worksheet) files from me in a zip, so you can upload them to Sage all at once (I can also get you more info on the concepts behind the experiment). To get the project working properly you would need to follow the directions in the section labeled organization at the end of the read me. This file is also the key for interpreting the randomly assigned ids each page has.


Theory:

Each student completes 3 randomly selected problem sets with the condition (a being a baseline control, b being standard treatment type control, and c being the experimental condition) randomly selected for each. Since I don't want to assume students can TeX, as much of their work is written as possible. The quality of proof for the second question, the amount of time spent on it, and the amount of time spent total on a problem set (both recorded in this program) are the DVs. Each type of problem will be collapsed across the 4 problem sets (three for each student) for analysis. My hypothesis is that the conjecturing problem will be as valuable to the final proof, as a standard method, compared to simply doing a two problem problem set with the problems 'unrelated'.



Organization:

To configure these worksheets correctly: make sure all the problem and problem set
worksheets other than interacts are published; record the new URLs (they seem to be
randomly given when uploading the worksheets from a zip) based on the Worksheets'
name (I only use the second URL for the published worksheets). Now type the URLs
into the urls array near the top of the javascript for the "Experiment Home" page
in the order corresponding to the order given below. Then record that worksheets URL
and put it in for the URL on the fourth line. You may want to adjust the three right
most entries (currently 5000) of the timeLimits array (last item in the variables
section) to 1000 each for testing purposes.
