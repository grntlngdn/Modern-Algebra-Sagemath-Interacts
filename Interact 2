<p>A&nbsp;<em>finite continued fraction</em> is of the form</p>
<p style="-qt-block-indent: 0; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;">$$a_0+\cfrac{1}{a_1+\cfrac{1}{a_2+\cfrac{1}{\begin{split}a_3+\ddots\qquad \quad\\+\cfrac{1}{a_n}.\end{split}}}}$$</p>
<p style="-qt-block-indent: 0; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="-qt-block-indent: 0; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;">Note by adding $a_{n-1}+\frac{1}{a_n}$ to get a single fraction one is given a shorter continued fraction ending with $a_{n-2}+\frac{1}{\frac{a_{n-1}a_n+1}{a_n}}$, and then reciprocating the term on the right one can repeat this process; continuing with such a process one will eventually write this entire continued fraction as a single fraction. Assuming $a_i\in\mathbb Z$ for $i\ge0$, this shows the entire continued fraction is equal to some common fraction $\frac{h}{k}$ where $h,k\in \mathbb Z$. We will assume this as well as that $a_i&gt;0$ for $i&gt;0$ and $a_n&gt;1$ from now on, in which case given $h,k\in \mathbb Z$ there is only one way to write $\frac{h}{k}$ in this form; call this its continued fraction representation.</p>
<p style="-qt-block-indent: 0; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;">Let $M&gt;2$ be an integer. Before continuing write down a continued fraction with $n&gt;4$ and the common fraction that it represents on your paper. Make a conjecture of the form "in the set of continued fractions representing some $\frac{h}{k}$ where $0&lt;h,k&lt;M$ the longest continued fraction (the one with $n$ the greatest) is ________," after observing continued fractions of various $\frac{a}{b}$.</p>
<p>Click in then press "evaluate" on the cell immediately below these instructions. You will now be able to manipulate the controls to observe their effects. Note $a=m+i$ and $b=n+j$. Calculations can be done by typing ("2+(1/(3+1/4))", for instance) in the bottom most cell and then pressing "evaluate".</p>
<p>&nbsp;Write down ten of the common fractions and corresponding continued fractions that you observe on your paper. Once you believe you have completed your conjecture: write it down, write down a value of $M$ greater than 100 and greater than any value of $a$ or $b$ you have observed and the values $h,k&lt;M$ that your conjecture predicts will give the longest continued fraction, write down ten values of $\frac{a}{b}$ with $a,b&lt;M$ that you haven't observed below along with the lengths of their continued fractions. If the lengths are all less than that of $\frac{h}{k}$, press the close button at the bottom of the screen. Otherwise, observe more values of $r$ and $p$ below to come up with another conjecture, and then repeat these steps starting with writing down the new conjecture.</p>
